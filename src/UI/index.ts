/**
 * Basic user interface components designed to simplify custom styling of the application.
 * 
 * Most UI components are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts,
 * as they are mostly wrappers around their native counterparts using [`styled-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components).
 * 
 * For example, `<input />` can be replaced with `<UI.Input />` using all of the same `props`.
 * 
 * Other components (e.g., `Modal`, `Spinner`, etc.) don't typically have native counterparts
 * but are common and generic enough to be considered a user interface component.
